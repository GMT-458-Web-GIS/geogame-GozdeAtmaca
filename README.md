##  Flag Hunt — A Country Guessing Game with Flag

##  Aim
The aim of this project is to design and develop an interactive geo-game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with OpenLayers.  
The game encourages users to test their geographical knowledge by matching country flags with their correct locations on a world map.  


## Game Description

**FLAG HUNT** is a time-based geo-game where the player must correctly identify the location of a country on a world map by clicking on it after seeing its flag.  

The game includes:

• A continent filter (e.g., Europe, Asia, Africa)  
• A 60-second countdown timer with a visual progress bar  
• Randomly selected country flags each round  
• A scoring system (+10 points for correct guesses, -5 seconds for wrong ones)


## Game Mechanics

• *Gameplay* : A random flag appears, and the user clicks on the corresponding country on the map. 
• *Timer* : 60 seconds total with a progress bar animation. 
• *Scoring* : +10 points if the guess is within 500 km; -5 seconds for wrong guesses. 
• *Filter* : The player can select a continent or region before starting the game. 
• *Goal* : Achieve the highest possible score before time runs out. 



## Technologies and Libraries

• HTML, CSS, JavaScript
• OpenLayers : For interactive web map visualization  
• ol/sphere : For geographic distance calculations  
• flagpedia.net : To retrieve flag images
